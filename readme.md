Environmental Data Dashboard
A Python-based application that fetches, caches, and displays environmental data from public APIs on an interactive dashboard. This project is designed to provide real-time insights into key environmental metrics like water quality and air pollution.
üöÄ Features
Real-Time Data: Fetches up-to-the-minute data from the USGS Water Services API.
API Caching: Implements a local file cache to reduce redundant API calls, speeding up development and data loading.
Interactive Visualizations: (Planned) Will use libraries like Plotly and Dash to create interactive charts and maps.
Data Analysis: (Planned) Will incorporate Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Extensible: Designed to be easily extended with new data sources (e.g., EPA AirNow).
üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.
1. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/environmental-dashboard.git
cd environmental-dashboard


2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


3. Install Dependencies:
The required Python libraries are listed in requirements.txt.
pip install -r requirements.txt


‚öôÔ∏è Usage
To run the main script and fetch the data, execute the following command in your terminal:
python main.py


The first time you run the script, it will fetch data from the API and create a local cache file (e.g., usgs_data.json). Subsequent runs will load data directly from this cache.
üìä Data Sources
This dashboard currently utilizes the following public APIs:
USGS Water Services API: Provides real-time and historical data on water resources across the United States.
